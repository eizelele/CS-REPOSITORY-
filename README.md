FamiLynk: Keeping the families in sync 

Problem Statement:

Many Filipino households struggle with keeping track of daily tasks, schedules, and responsibilities. This often leads to missed bills, forgotten chores, wasted food, and disorganized routines. Families need a more efficient, centralized system to coordinate household management.

Proposed Solution:

We propose FamiLynk, a family-centered mobile application designed to improve household organization and strengthen family coordination. Within one year of implementation, FamiLynk aims to:

Ensure at least 80% of scheduled tasks are completed on time through its calendar, grocery list, and bill reminder features.

Reduce wasted food and missed maintenance by at least 80% through pantry tracking, expiration date monitoring, and chore/repair reminders.

Enhance family safety and coordination through location tracking and shared responsibilities.


 Features:

1. Shared Family Calendar – synchronize schedules and appointments.


2. Synced Grocery List – collaborative shopping made easy.


3. Bill Tracker with Reminders – avoid late payments.


4. Pet Care Scheduling – reminders for feeding, grooming, and vet visits.


5. Pantry Tracking & Expiration Monitoring – reduce food waste.


6. Pinoy-Based Recipe Suggestions – maximize available ingredients.


7. Chore & Repair Reminders – prevent household neglect.


8. Location Tracking – improve safety and coordination among family members.



Uniqueness of FamiLynk

Unlike existing family management apps, FamiLynk integrates all these features in one platform, tailored specifically to Filipino households. While some apps may offer a few similar functions, none combine them as comprehensively as FamiLynk.

Expected Outcomes

Improved household efficiency and organization.

Strengthened family cooperation and accountability.

Reduced stress caused by disorganized routines.

A more harmonious, connected, and secure family life.
